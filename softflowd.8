.Op Fl dDh
.Op Fl i Ar interface
.Op Fl r Ar pcap_file

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a software implementation of a flow-based network traffic monitor. 
.Nm
reads network traffic and gathers information about active traffic flows. 
A "traffic flow" is 
communication between two IP addresses or (if the overlying protocol is 
TCP or UDP) address/port tuples. 
.Pp
The intended use of
.Nm 
is as a software implementation of Cisco's NetFlow(tm) traffic account
system.
.Nm 
supports data export using version 1 of the NetFlow protocol. 
.Nm 
can also run in statistics-only mode, where it just collects summary 
information. Currently, too few statistics are collected to make this
mode really useful.
.Pp
Network traffic may be obtained by listening on a promiscuous network
interface or by reading stored
.Xr pcap 3
files, such as those written by 
.Xr tcpdump 8 .
Traffic may be filtered with an optional
.Xr bpf 4
program, specified on the command-line as
.Ar bpf_prog .
.Pp
.Nm
tries to track only active traffic flows. When the
flow has been quiescent for a period of time it is expired automatically. 
Flows may also be expired early if they approach their traffic counts 
exceed 2Gb or if the number of flows being tracked exceeds 
.Ar max_flows
(default: 8192). In this last case, flows are expired oldest-first. 
Flow expiry checking is done every 
.Ar check_wait
seconds (default: 8).
.Pp
Upon expiry, the flow information is accumulated into statistics which may
be viewed using 
.Xr softflowctl 8 .
If the 
.Fl n
option has been specified the flow informaion is formatted in a UDP datagram 
which is compatible with version 1 of Cisco's NetFlow(tm) accounting export
format. These records are sent to the specified
.Ar host
and
.Ar port .
.Pp
The command-line options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl n Ar host:port
Specify the 
.Ar host
(an IP address in dotted-quad format) and 
.Ar port
that the accounting datagrams are to be sent to.
.It Fl i Ar interface
Specify a network interface on which to listen for traffic. Either the 
.Fl i
or the
.Fl r 
options must be specified.
.It Fl r Ar pcap_file
Specify that
.Nm
should read from a 
.Xr pcap 3
packet capture (such as one created with the 
.Fl w
option of 
.Xr tcpdump 8 )
file rather than a network interface. 
.Nm
processes the whole capture file and only expires flows when 
.Ar max_flows
is exceeded. In this mode, 
.Nm
will not fork and will automatically print summary statistics before 
exiting.
.It Fl p Ar pidfile
Specify an alternate location to store the process-id when in daemon mode.
Default is 
.Pa /var/run/softflowd.pid
.It Fl c Ar ctlsock
Specify an alternate location for the remote control socket in daemon mode.
Default is 
.Pa /var/run/softflowd.pid
.It Fl m Ar max_flows
Specifies the maximum number of flow to concurrently track. If this  limit
is exceeded, the flows which have least recently seen traffic are forcibly
expired. In practice, the actual maximum may briefly exceed this limit by a
small amount as  expiry processing happens less frequently than traffic
collection. The default is 8192 flows, which corresponds to slightly less
than 800k of working data.
.It Fl t Ar timeout_name=time
Set the timeout names
.Ar timeout_name
to 
.Ar time 
in seconds.
Refer to the 
.Sx TIMEOUTS
section for the valid timeout names and their meanings.
.It Fl d
Specify that 
.Nm
should not fork and daemonise itself.
.It Fl D
Places
.Nm
in a debugging mode. This implies the 
.Fl d
flag and turns on additional debugging output.
.It Fl h
Displays commandline usage information.
.El
.Pp
.Sh TIMEOUTS
.Nm
will expire quiescent flows after user-configurable periods. The exact 
timeout used depends on the nature of the flow. The various timeouts 
that may be set from the command-line (using the 
.Fl t 
option) and their meanings are:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ar general
This is the general timeout applied to all traffic unless overridden by 
one of the other timeouts.
.It Ar tcp
This is the general TCP timeout, applied to open TCP connections.
.It Ar tcp.rst
This timeout is applied to a TCP connection when a RST packet has been 
sent by one or both endpoints.
.It Ar tcp.fin
This timeout is applied to a TCP connection when a FIN packet has been
sent by both endpoints.
.It Ar udp
This is the general UDP timeout, applied to all UDP connections.
.It Ar maxlife
This is the maximum lifetime that a flow may exist for. All flows 
are forcibly expired when they pass
.Ar maxlife
seconds. To disable this feature, specify a 
.Ar maxlife
of 0.
.El
.Pp
Flows may also be expired if there are not enough flow entries to hold them
or if their traffic exceeds 2Gb in either direction. 
.Xr softflowctl 8
may be used to print information on the average lifetimes of flows and 
the reasons for their expiry.
.Sh RUN-TIME CONTROL
A daemonised
.Nm
instance may be controlled using the 
.Xr softflowctl 8
command. This interface allows one to shut down the daemon, force expiry of
all tracked flows and extract debugging and summary data. Also, upon 
receipt of a 
.Dv SIGTERM
or 
.DV SIGINT
.Nm
will cause 
.Nm
to exit, after expiring all flows (and thus sending flow export packets 
if 
.Fl -n 
was specified on the commandline). If you do not want to export flows upon
shutdown, clear them first with
.Xr softflowctl 8 .
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Pa /var/run/softflowd.pid
This file stores the process-id when
.Nm
is in daemon mode. This location may be overridden using the 
.Fl p
command-line option.
.It Pa /var/run/softflowd.ctl
This is the remote control socket. 
.Nm 
listens on this socket for commands from 
.Xr softflowctl 8 . This location may be overridden using the 
.Fl c
command-line option.
