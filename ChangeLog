 - (djm) Fixup collector timestamp printing
 - (djm) Rework TODO, add section on planned fragment handling
 - (djm) Add "strip" target to Makefile
 - (djm) Add "help" keyword to recognised softflowctl responses
 - (djm) Fix fragment handling bug: we would try to look into fragmented
   payload on later fragments. This could cause random tcp/udp  port numbers
   to be recorded.
 - (djm) Fix malicious fragment handling bug: deliberately tiny fragments 
   (e.g. http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/ptacek98insertion.html) would be ignored
   and would not create flow entries.
 - (djm) Count fragments that we have seen
 - (djm) Release version 0.8.1

20021030
 - (djm) New user-friendly time specification code from OpenSSH/Kevin Steves

20021029
 - (djm) Multiple fixes and improvements from Octavian Cerna <tavy@ylabs.com>
    - softflowd.c (connsock): Fix arguments to `connect': addr is a pointer, 
	not a structure.
      (flow_update_expiry): Properly compute the flow lifetime.
      (send_netflow_v1): Count the leftover packet.
	Send flow_start, flow_finish and uptime_ms as Cisco equipment 
	does: milliseconds since system boot.
      (timeval_sub_ms): New function.
      (main): Changed POLL_WAIT to be (EXPIRY_WAIT/2) as stated in the 
	comment above `poll': twice per recheck.
	`poll' takes the last argument in milliseconds.
	Initialize system_boot_time as the time at the start of capture
	(fixme: how does this affect reading from capture files?)
