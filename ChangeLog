 - (djm) Multiple fixes and improvements from Octavian Cerna <tavy@ylabs.com>
    - softflowd.c (connsock): Fix arguments to `connect': addr is a pointer, 
	not a structure.
      (flow_update_expiry): Properly compute the flow lifetime.
      (send_netflow_v1): Count the leftover packet.
	Send flow_start, flow_finish and uptime_ms as Cisco equipment 
	does: milliseconds since system boot.
      (timeval_sub_ms): New function.
      (main): Changed POLL_WAIT to be (EXPIRY_WAIT/2) as stated in the 
	comment above `poll': twice per recheck.
	`poll' takes the last argument in milliseconds.
	Initialize system_boot_time as the time at the start of capture
	(fixme: how does this affect reading from capture files?)
