 - (djm) A bunch of changes necessary to support building on Solaris 9 (though
   the resultant binary doesn't seem to work properly):
        - Use getaddrinfo instead of inet_aton to parse host/port for export
        - Use setreuid if setresuid isn't around (ditto for gid)
        - Add replacement daemon() function from OpenBSD
        - Provide our own logit() function, because Solaris syslog() doesn't 
          support LOG_PERROR
        - A heap of configure and common.h additions and fixes
 - (djm) Fix busted preprocessor
 - (djm) Support "[host]:port" syntax to specify numeric IPv6 export target
 - (djm) Fix connect() for IPv6 export targets
 - (djm) IPv6 listen support for collector.pl
 - (djm) Allow v4 operation of collector.pl if v6 modules aren't present
 - (djm) More flow export fixes
 - (djm) Tidy manpage and mention v6 export syntax
 - (djm) Unbreak Solaris, pass socklen around instead of using sa_len
 - (djm) Unbreak "make install"

20040415
 - (djm) Clear socket errors before UDP send; from pfflowd
 - (djm) Print flow start and finish times in collector.pl
 - (djm) Linux needs grp.h for setgroups()
 - (djm) Never endprotoent()
 - (djm) Use autoconf to detect various things; in preparation of more 
   portability
 - (djm) Detect int and define standard int types in configure

20031111
 - (djm) Remove -Werror from CFLAGS, it causes problems in released software

20031109
 - (djm) Give compile-time choice over flow and expiry event tree type
   default is splay tree for flows and red-black tree for expiry events
   (limited benchmarking indicates that this is the fastest)
 - (djm) Lock the BPF device to prevent changes should the unpriv child
   be compromised (only OpenBSD supports this ioctl for now)

20031001
 - (djm) Realloc audit
 - (djm) Chroot to /var/empty and drop privileges on daemonisation
 - (djm) More things TODO

20030620
 - (djm) Fixup collector timestamp printing
 - (djm) Rework TODO, add section on planned fragment handling
 - (djm) Add "strip" target to Makefile
 - (djm) Add "help" keyword to recognised softflowctl responses
 - (djm) Fix fragment handling bug: we would try to look into fragmented
   payload on later fragments. This could cause random tcp/udp  port numbers
   to be recorded.
 - (djm) Fix malicious fragment handling bug: deliberately tiny fragments 
   (e.g. http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/ptacek98insertion.html) would be ignored
   and would not create flow entries.
 - (djm) Count fragments that we have seen
 - (djm) Release version 0.8.1

20030307
 - (djm) Add basic perl netflow collector

20021110
 - (djm) Refactor, dramatically shrink mainloop

20021105
 - (djm) Don't exit on failure to lookup net/mask. From Alejandro Roman 
   <aroman@uyr.com.ar>

20021031
 - (djm) Add some examples to the manpage

20021030
 - (djm) New user-friendly time specification code from OpenSSH/Kevin Steves
 - (djm) Always use local sys-tree.h (for older OpenBSD's)

20021029
 - (djm) Multiple fixes and improvements from Octavian Cerna <tavy@ylabs.com>
    - softflowd.c (connsock): Fix arguments to `connect': addr is a pointer, 
	not a structure.
      (flow_update_expiry): Properly compute the flow lifetime.
      (send_netflow_v1): Count the leftover packet.
	Send flow_start, flow_finish and uptime_ms as Cisco equipment 
	does: milliseconds since system boot.
      (timeval_sub_ms): New function.
      (main): Changed POLL_WAIT to be (EXPIRY_WAIT/2) as stated in the 
	comment above `poll': twice per recheck.
	`poll' takes the last argument in milliseconds.
	Initialize system_boot_time as the time at the start of capture
	(fixme: how does this affect reading from capture files?)

20021024
 - (djm) Release softflowd-0.7.1
