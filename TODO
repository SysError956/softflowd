Things yet to do:

general
-------
  - autoconf (not if we can avoid it)

softflowd
---------

  - We don't handle fragments right
    - This shouldn't be too hard or too memory intensive. We just need to 
      keep a tree of fragment entries. Each entry would need to contain 
      enough information to reconstruct the flow (source/dest addr, etc), 
      but also fragment related info: IP id, list of fragment offsets. etc.
    - When we receive a new fragment, we add an entry to this tree (keyed 
      by source IP, protocol, IP id)
    - Each new fragment matched in the tree gets its offset added to the 
      list, until all fragments have been seen
    - Must be careful, as later fragments may arrive before inital one
    - When does accounting occur? 
      - Upon receipt of inital fragment? (and thus for ever frag thereafter)
      - When we have seen all fragments? (what if we don't?)
    - Must limit size of tree
    - Must have fragment timeout (what happens then, apart from removal?)

  - Timeout for unanswered TCP connection
  - Ditto orphaned connections (one packet in one direction only)
  - Track ICMP generated by TCP/UDP session (painful, probably unecessary)
  - More datalink types
  - Improve fast-expiry of TCP session by tracking FIN sequence numbers
  - IPv6 support (I don't think netflow supports it yet)
  - Enqueue expired flows in struct FLOWTRACK rather than sending 
    immediately upon expiry
    - Ability to set soft mininum number of flow records per packet
    - Need timeout so the queue doesn't rot
    - Benefits of queue vs leaving them in flow table???
  - Collect more statistics (maybe)
    - Option to take histograms
    - Flow bandwidth
    - Per well-known-port
      - How to do this quicky? Memory efficiently?
    - Per IP address/range
      - How to do this quicky? Memory efficiently?
    - Moving averages
  - Ability to freeze/resume state (maybe)
  - Ability to open more than one interface (maybe)
  - Ability to read more than one pcap file (maybe)
  - Option for no statistics mode? (decreased CPU, I don't think it matters)
  - Option for fixed expiry timers? (for decreased per-packet CPU)
  - Fork for ctlsock actions? (don't block mainloop)
  - sflow support (www.sflow.org)
    - Needs XDR encoding
    - But will give us IPv6 flow export support

softflowctl
-----------

  - Extend interface
    - Query for specific flows (e.g. by address)
      - Do this in softflowd or softflowctl?
    - Expire/delete specific flows (maybe)
  - Runtime respecify pcap filter
  - Runtime respecify timeouts
  - Change dev in midstream (unlikely)
  - Real-time binary dump of flowtable (shm/mmap fd pass?)
    - ntop like view
    - Spiffy GUI (separate tool)
  - Ability to start up softflowd (maybe, probably not)

collector
---------

 - More / better logging
 - Compact binary logs
   - time / sender / src addr / dst addr / octets / proto / src port / dst port
   - u32  / u32    / u32      / u32      / u32      u16   / u16      / u16
   - u16 of zero or CRC16 padding to 224 bytes per record
   - Reader tool required
   - Daemon mode
