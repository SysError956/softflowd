Things yet to do:

general
-------
  - autoconf (not if we can avoid it)

softflowd
---------

  - We don't handle fragments right for tcp/udp
  - Timeout for unanswered TCP connection
  - Ditto orphaned connections (one packet in one direction only)
  - Track ICMP generated by TCP/UDP session (painful)
  - More datalink types
  - Improve fast-expiry of TCP session by tracking FIN sequence numbers
  - IPv6 support (I don't think netflow supports it yet)
  - Enqueue expired flows in struct FLOWTRACK rather than sending 
    immediately upon expiry
    - Ability to set soft mininum number of flow records per packet
    - Need timeout so the queue doesn't rot
    - Benefits of queue vs leaving them in flow table???
  - Collect more statistics
    - Option to take histograms (maybe)
    - Flow bandwidth
    - Per well-known-port
      - How to do this quicky? Memory efficiently?
    - Per IP address/range
      - How to do this quicky? Memory efficiently?
    - Moving averages
  - Ability to freeze/resume state (maybe)
  - Ability to open more than one interface (maybe)
  - Ability to read more than one pcap file
  - Split out control sock handling from main loop more

softflowctl
-----------

  - Extend interface
    - Query for specific flows (e.g. by address)
      - Expire/delete specific flows (maybe)
  - Runtime respecify pcap filter
  - Runtime respecify timeouts
  - Change dev in midstream (maybe)
  - Real-time binary dump of flowtable (shm/mmap fd pass?)
    - ntop like view
    - Spiffy GUI (separate tool)
  - Ability to start up softflowd (maybe)
