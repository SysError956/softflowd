Welcome to softflowd, a flow-based network monitor. 

More details about softflowd's function and usage may be found in the
supplied manpages, which you can view prior to installation using 

/usr/bin/nroff -c -mandoc softflowd.8 | less
/usr/bin/nroff -c -mandoc softflowctl.8 | less

Building softflowd should be as simple as typing "make". Unfortunately 
some systems like to make life complicated. Things work fine on the 
systems that I develop and test on (OpenBSD 3.1/3.2 and Redhat Linux 
7.3/8.0).

Softflowd derives from an earlier project of mine: traffic-vis. 
Unfortunately traffic-vis is many years stale, not designed for speed and
was written by a younger, less experienced version of myself.

Softflowd itself is licensed under a two-term BSD license (see the source
files for details). 

The code in sys-tree.h is Copyright 2002 Niels Provos <provos@citi.umich.edu> 
and comes straight from OpenBSD CVS, convtime.c comes is Copyright 2001 
Kevin Steves and comes from OpenSSH (misc.c). Both of these files are 
licensed under two-term BSD licenses too.
